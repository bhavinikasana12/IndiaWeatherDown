# IndiaWeatherDown 
> A CNN-Transformer model for high-resolution weather downscaling over India (1.5° → 0.25°)
>
> ## Motivation
ArchesWeather (Couairon et al., 2024) produces accurate global weather forecasts at 1.5° resolution — too coarse for regional applications like cyclone tracking or monsoon prediction over India. This project builds a lightweight downscaling model that sharpens these predictions to 0.25° specifically for the Indian subcontinent.
